This is a basic todo app which supports; Adding a new task, deleting the task, and marking it as complete.
It is built using html, css, and vanilla javascript. ..
First part done i.e. place to add tasks.
Styled the place to add lists. Also, included images for checking and unchecking. No remaining is js.
Tryied adding js functionality to the add buton. For some reason, it sint working.. Need to research more about it.
Yaaay I solved the above isue. Now i can comfortably add todo lists into the list. The button is working perfectly and seamlessly. And appending a new item to the already existing list.
